SIG-Comp places students in a competitive environment to encourage<br>
self-improvement and provide a benchmark by which they can measure<br>
their growth. Members will build up algorithmic problem-solving skills<br>
and learn to communicate their solutions in a supportive environment.<br>
Our focus on practical application of the Computer Science curriculum<br>
gives students the confidence to succeed in research and industry.<br>

SIG-Comp welcomes students of all majors and skill-levels with open arms
