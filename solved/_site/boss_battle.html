<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2>

<p>The question asks for the number of bombs thrown <em>in the worst case</em>. In this case the bomb is thrown two pillars in front of the boss, and subsequent bomb throws are away from the bossâ€™s initial location. The boss moves in the same direction that the bombs are being thrown. This is best demonstrated visually. In the image below, grey circles represent the bomb-affected pillars and the orange circle is the location of the boss.</p>

<p>Now, visualize the circle unravelling into a straight line. It would look like the following image.</p>

<p>Let n be the number of pillars. Notice that, given the way the circles have been numbered, the boss starts at position n - 2. Let x represent how many bombs have been thrown so far. Then the expression for where the bomb is targeted at is 2x. The expression for where the boss is at is x + n - 2. Setting the equations equal to each other will yield how many bombs must be thrown before the boss is finally hit: 2x = x + n - 2. Subtract x from both sides to get x = n - 2. So it will take n - 2 bombs being thrown to hit the boss in the worst case scenario. Graphically, this looks like the following image:</p>

<p>Note that for values less than 3, the boss will always be hit on the first throw, since the bomb radius is 3.</p>
